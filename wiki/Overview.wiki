#Brief introduction to py-office-tools

=Overview=

This is a set of tools to support reading (and eventually writing) of the Excel and PowerPoint binary file formats. It relies on the OleFileIO_PL module to deal with the underlying CBFF format. This tool focuses on the storages/streams that contain the application level data for Excel and PowerPoint.

==What it does==

Prints out detailed information about Excel and PowerPoint records ("Workbook" and "PowerPoint Document" streams), as well as property sets in the DocumentSummary and DocumentSummaryInformation streams.

==How it does==

I took the Excel and PowerPoint specs, converted them to HTML, fixed up lots of broken ass stuff, and then used those as input to a code generator that spit out Python structures describing the records.

==If you don't like my code (likely) or python==

Take the HTML files and use them to generate code in a language of your choice.
